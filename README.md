# Qt DataVisualization to Qt Graphs

Welcome to the repository for the course "Qt DataVisualization to Qt Graphs" on [Qt Academy](https://academy.qt.io).

## Getting Started
In the tutorial, you will learn how to migrate  an application using the the Qt DataVisualization Module to the Qt Graphs Module. Focusing on the practical steps required for migration, we'll guide you through key changes in CMake configurations, code, and asset handling.

The repository contains two projects, `qt-academy-example-qtdatavis3d` and `qt-academy-example-qtgraphs`. The `qt-academy-example-qtdatavis3d` project is the starting point for the tutorial, and the `qt-academy-example-qtgraphs` project is the final project after migration.

The Qt Graphs project is there for reference and to help you understand the changes made during the migration process. You can use this to compare the changes you make in the tutorial.

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt and an IDE (e.g Qt Creator) installed on your computer. You can download Qt and Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and an IDE installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run the project in Qt Creator, navigate to the folder `qt-academy-example-qtdatavis3d` open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.

Ensure you have the Qt DataVisualization and Qt Graphs modules from the Qt Maintenance Tool. You should use Qt 6.8.1 or later for all the features in the Qt Graphs application to work correctly. Qt 6.8.0 will work, but some features will not function as intended.
